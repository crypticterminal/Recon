# Recon
Using SubBrute and Eyewitness to perform OSINT on a supplied domain.


Basic PoC first version using SubBrute and EyeWitness.

Usage:
./recon.sh DOMAIN

Example:
./recon.sh cisco.com

NOTE:
This first version uses hardcoded output for SubBrute file and the output directory for EyeWitness.
Also does not output status while its running.

Will need Subbrute and EyeWitness installed in the static directories defined in the script (CHANGE TO FIT YOUR NEEDS).
